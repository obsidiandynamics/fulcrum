/**
 *  Embodiment of the <b>FS.lock</b> reentrant, interprocess exclusive locking protocol. <p>
 *  
 *  FS.lock builds on the {@link java.nio.channels.FileLock} class, as the underlying cross-platform locking primitive.
 *  Locking is performed across two tiers: <b>root</b> and <b>node</b>. The root lock resides in a user-chosen
 *  directory (completely arbitrary, subject to file permissions) under the filename {@code .lock}.
 *  A node occupies a subdirectory immediately under the root directory; the node lock filename takes
 *  the form {@code node/.lock}, where {@code node} is the directory name. The node directory may also
 *  contain arbitrary user data; in which case the node lock can be perceived as an exclusive mutex over
 *  the persisted data. <p>
 *  
 *  When acquiring a node lock, the root lock is temporary acquired first. If the root lock is held
 *  by another JVM process (or another thread in the current process), acquisition aborts and may
 *  be re-attempted immediately thereafter (but typically after a backoff interval). If the root lock is
 *  acquired, the node lock acquisition is subsequently attempted. If successful, the {@link DirectoryLock} 
 *  is wrapped in a {@link ReentrantDirectoryLock} and returned to the caller. Whether or not the 
 *  node lock acquisition is successful, the root lock is subsequently released. <p>
 *  
 *  A node directory may be 'vacuumed'. This is essentially a mechanism for deleting an entire node
 *  directory (recursively) if no other process holds the node lock; used to purge user data that would
 *  otherwise be protected by a node lock. Vacuuming involves holding the root lock while recursively
 *  deleting the node directory. The root lock acts as barrier, preventing concurrent lock acquisition.
 *  (So that a node lock doesn't get re-acquired while the node directory is in the midst of being
 *  wiped.) The two-tier system is required to guarantee safe vacuuming. (Without vacuuming, a single-tier
 *  node lock would have sufficed.) Locks are acquired in a strictly top-down fashion â€” the root lock is
 *  always acquired first, followed by the node lock. A process never acquires a node lock without having
 *  secured the root lock first. <p>
 *  
 *  The process <em>must</em> ensure that a root lock is effectively singleton. Two root locks at the
 *  same location cannot coexist in the same process, as the {@link LockRoot} contains the definitive
 *  ledger of all node locks held under its province, the owner threads, entry counts and so forth. <p>
 *  
 *  This class is thread-safe.
