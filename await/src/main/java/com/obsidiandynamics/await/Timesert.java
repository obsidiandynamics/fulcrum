/**
 *  Timesert (a portmanteau of <i>time</i> and <i>assert</i>) adds timed
 *  assertion testing to {@link Await}. Unlike Awaitility, this implementation is
 *  robust in the face of a system clock that doesn't satisfy the monotonic
 *  non-decreasing assumption. (While rare, this assumption may be violated when
 *  using NTP, and is particularly problematic on macOS.)
 *  <p>
 *  
 *  Timesert is useful when writing and testing network applications and
 *  asynchronous systems in general, as events don't happen instantly. For
 *  example, when sending a message you might want to assert that it has been
 *  received. But running an assertion on the receiver immediately following a
 *  send in an asynchronous environment will likely fail. Using Timesert allows
 *  for assertions to fail up to a certain point, after which the
 *  {@link AssertionError} is percolated to the caller and the test case fails.
 *  This way Timesert allows you to write efficient, reproducible assertions
 *  without resorting to {@link Thread#sleep(long)}.
